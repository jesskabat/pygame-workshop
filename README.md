## Environment Setup

### Install Python

- [Official Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- If you are unfamiliar Python, don't worry! Here are some great quickstart guides for your reference:
    - [Python Cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/python)
    - [Learn X in Y Minutes (Python Edition)](https://learnxinyminutes.com/python/)

### Setup your development environment

1. Open a new project in your IDE (like VSCode)

2. Open a terminal in your project directory

3. Setup a virtual environment - Intellji does this for you
    1. In your terminal, while in the project directroy, run `python -m venv venv`.
        - This will create a new folder called `venv` in your project directory
        - This folder will contain the python packages, like `pygame`, you install for the project
        - If you don't use a virtual environment (venv), you will end up installing everything globally and potentially run into conflicts and other issues

        >If you get an error, try running `python3 -m venv venv`

    2. Then, activate the virtual environment by running the activation script
        - MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
        - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install pygame by running `pip install pygame`
    - `pip` is a package manager for python; use it to install packages you need for your project

5. Create the python file for the game!

## Basic Pygame Setup
Copy and paste the following code into your main `.py` file to get started. There are comments which explain the jist of the code.

```python
# imports
import sys

import pygame

# initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# variables for the window size
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
# init a pygame window. the set_mode function takes in a tuple (similar to a list, but immutable) for the window size
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
# initialize the clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# game loop. when you run this python file, the program will spend most of its time in this loop
run = True
while  run:
    # event loop
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            # if the user closes the window, exit the game loop
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    # game logic will go here!

    # draw logic will go here!
    ## clear the screen every frame before re-drawing
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    ## custom drawing logic goes here
    ## ...
    ## update the display with the newly drawn frame
    pygame.display.update()

    # update the clock. `clock.tick()` takes one argument, framerate
    # this needs to be called once per frame
    # if you are curious to how this works, look up pygame.time.Clock documentation,
    # then look for the tick() function
    clock.tick(60)
```

## Useful Pygame Functions

### Drawing

```python
# draw a rectangle
# PARAMS:
# screen is the window
# color is the color of the rectangle. simplest is to pass a tuple of RGB values, e.g. (255, 0, 0)
# rect is the rectangle, a tuple of (x, y, width, height)
    # x is left to right position of top left corner of the rectangle
    # y is top to bottom position of top left corner of the rectangle
    # width is the width of the rectangle (left to right)
    # height is the height of the rectangle (top to bottom)
pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, rect)

# draw a circle
# PARAMS:
# center is a point (a tuple of (x, y) coordinates)
pygame.draw.circle(screen, color, center, radius)

# draw a line
# PARAMS:
# start and end are points
pygame.draw.line(screen, color, start, end)
```

### Input Events

```python
# get the current state of the keys
keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
# if 'a' key is pressed
if keys[pygame.K_a]:
    # do something
```

The official pygame documentation can be found [here](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), including basic examples. 

Your IDE (more specifically, the language server which your IDE manages) can also be very helpful when navigating external libraries.

Don't forget the [Python Cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/python) and [Learn X in Y Minutes (Python Edition)](https://learnxinyminutes.com/python/) for Python things too.
